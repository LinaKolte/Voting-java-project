# Voting Application

This is my first project â€” a *secure and interactive online voting application* built using *Java Spring Boot*.

## ðŸ”’ Features
- *OTP Verification* â€“ Ensures that only verified users can cast their vote securely.
- *Face Detection* â€“ Adds an extra layer of security by verifying the voterâ€™s identity through face recognition before voting.
- *Voting Dashboard* â€“ Displays real-time voting results, showing how many votes each candidate has received.

This project demonstrates the integration of modern authentication techniques with biometric security to create a trustworthy and user-friendly voting system.
